We have already seen agent generated content flooding our online spaces. While there are many people working on watermarking technologies, they are easily gamebale and therefore the real applications are restricted.

I would like to propose a new idea to design a new set of encodings for AI/agent generated cotent (e.g. UTF-AI). So essentially for all the agent communications, they should be done with AI specific encodings. These 
content should look exactly the same as human language, however, they should be encoded with a seperate set of chars so that computer systems can easily tell whether they are generated by agent or human.
